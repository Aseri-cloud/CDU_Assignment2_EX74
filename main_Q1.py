# """Cipher logic for Q1.

#Encryption rules (apply per character):
#- a–m: shift FORWARD by (shift1 * shift2)
#- n–z: shift BACKWARD by (shift1 + shift2)
#- A–M: shift BACKWARD by (shift1)
#- N–Z: shift FORWARD by (shift2 ** 2)
#- All other characters unchanged.

#Decryption must be the exact inverse of the above.
